Itâ€™s a Perks Platform for NFT communities to organize information and send notifications to holders about upcoming events

Not another Zeely or Twitter raid-for-dust tool

## Imagine this:

1) You just bought an NFT. Whatâ€™s next?
On Platform, you can instantly see:
â€¢ Roles you can claim
â€¢ Live activities you can join
â€¢ Past events from that project

2) You are already a holder? Every event comes with a timer, so youâ€™ll never miss it. Drop? WL? AMA?

3) For creators, itâ€™s a way to organize a Portfolio of their long time work
Most information gets lost on Twitter or Discord. Discord forums, in particular, are not great for sharing perks or keeping things structured. After 1y or 2y you can easily find everything

## Upcoming features:

1) Smart Notifications
People are busy and donâ€™t want to waste time browsing dozens of sites including "Platform". But with Platform, you can set personalized notifications to Telegram or Discord
As soon as a creator posts a new card, you get notified
Donâ€™t worry â€” you control the parameters and decide what updates you want. No spam and tons of notifications!
You donâ€™t even need to open Platform â€” it just works in the background

2) On-chain Personal Progress
Wallet-based identification will track your activity
â€¢ If you complete a task â€” itâ€™s marked as Completed
â€¢ If you miss it â€” itâ€™s marked as Closed
This creates your personal stats and achievements in each of collections you hold

3) Open Access for NFT Creators.
Have multiple NFTs? Follow all of them in one place
Your notifications are flexible â€” set preferences per project
In a bull run, where information chaos is everywhere, organized information becomes a superpower

Save time with a Platform
